// The client's navigation (docs/navigation.md): the zone's mesh (nav/zone_nav.h), the walk along a path
// (nav/path_follower.h) and the goals /nav and /moveto give it (nav/nav_control.h). The original client has no
// navigation; this is a Hailstone addition. It drives only what a player drives (the heading and the movement keys),
// once a frame, where /follow does (app/client_app_player.cpp).
//
// Doors are not in the zone's collision, so the mesh runs through doorways whatever the door's state. A closed door
// on the path a little way ahead is clicked as soon as it is within reach, without stopping, so it is open by the
// time the walk gets there; one that still blocks is clicked when the walk stalls in front of it
// (PathOptions::open_doors). A door whose click teleports cannot be told apart in RoF2's door record, so the option
// exists to turn this off (docs/unknowns.md).
//
// The mesh is read from the cache at the zone-in when there is a file for the zone, and otherwise built when it is
// first wanted (a /nav, the overlay, the Navigation TLO's path questions), or at the zone-in with nav.prebuild. A
// walk asked for before its tiles are there waits for them; a walk to a spawn asks the server for its path meanwhile
// (OP_FindPersonRequest, as /find asks it, but quietly: no path drawn, no sound; GameConnection::request_quiet_path),
// which a stock EQEmu server answers from its own navigation mesh when it has one. A walk that needs a new path while
// the mesh is still unfinished waits for its tiles (and asks the server again) rather than giving up.
